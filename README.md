# Degiro Portfolio Tracker

## Features (TODO)

- Import exported .csv of Degiro and read the data
- Be able to keep a single file of imported data so that the user doesn't need to keep importing from the start
- Show different graphs such as:
  - Price return
  - Fee ratio
  - (Don't know what else I can show that would be useful :))
- I want to be able to fetch information about the value of the assets at the time. So for example what was the price of a certain ETF when the program was run
